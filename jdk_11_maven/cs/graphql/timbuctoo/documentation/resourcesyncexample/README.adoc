= Resource sync example server

== Background
Timbuctoo should be able to import RDF-data (n-quads) provided by a resource sync server.
To be able to test this functionality.

== How to use
//tag::startup[]
Simply run `docker-compose up` and the service will start at localhost port 80 (default http port).
//end:startup[]
Open the uri `http://localhost/.well-known/resourcesync` to list the resource sync files.

== Contents of this example server

According to the resource sync spec we placed the source description (`sourcedescription.xml`) in the `./well-known/resourcesync` folder.
This source description sums up the available.

Another option is `robots.txt` that points to the resource list of `dataset1`.

The third option is to use an html or a response with a link to the capability list of a data set.
And example of this is `html_with_link.html` in teh folder of `dataset2`.
